# Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOP)
The field of multi-agent systems is an area of research with increasing interest. In a multi-agent system, autonomous agents interact in a shared environment to attain personal interests and/or to complete common goals. Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOP) is a framework that models the agents autonomous behaviour, coordination and communication according to the problems structure.

## Objective
This repository models a multi-agent environment for scheduled meetings with multiple constraints and solves the problem with dynamic programming optimization.

## Dependencies
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
